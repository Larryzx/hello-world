# hello-world
A repository such as this one hello-world is used  by developers like a shared area for files image etc.
hi I am trying to fingure out how to usse github apparently it is used by developers for changes and edits to be made by using things called branches which are copies of the thing called a master, this master is a snap shot of the program or code at that time we then make suggested edits and changs to a branch or a copy of the master these changes cna be disussed and if all concencerned like them we can comit the changes to the master which will merge the edit made. This will then update the master.


I think we use a pull request to up date the master..

These edits ae only made to the readme0-edits branch
Now you have two branches, master and readme-edits. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we’ll add our changes to the new branch.


Step 3. Make and commit changes
Bravo! Now, you’re on the code view for your readme-edits branch, which is a copy of master. Let’s make some edits.
